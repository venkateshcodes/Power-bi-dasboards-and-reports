Hereâ€™s an understandable description for your Power BI Call Center Analytics dashboard:

Project Description:

I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze three months of call center data, focusing on improving customer service efficiency. The dashboard provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average call duration, response and resolution times, call volume trends, and customer satisfaction levels.

The visuals highlight patterns in peak call hours, agent performance, and common customer issues. With these insights, the call center can make data-driven decisions to optimize staffing, reduce wait times, and improve overall customer experience.

This project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using Power BI, contributing to operational improvements.
